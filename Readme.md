This repository is an attempt to follow [Ruslan Spivak's](https://github.com/rspivak/) series called [Letâ€™s Build A Web Server](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/), I would recommend to visit the original blog post.

## What is a web server?
A web server is a network server that is based on a physical server.

## What is a network socket?
According to wikipedia *A network socket is a software structure within network node of computer that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network*

## How a basic web server works?
A web server uses a network socket to communicate with the client or in other word to serve the client. A client and a server uses HTTP protocol to talk to each other. A web server at the beginning opens up a socket connection and starts listening to a particular port for incoming requests. When it detects a request it then reads the request gives back response in the form of a HTTP response.
